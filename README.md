# hello-world
This is my first time on GitHub. I'm on my path to learn on how to use GitHub to create a repository and do other stuff such as collaborations and such.
I'm a ui/ux developer aspiring to convert my designs to real time code by majoring on frontend languages. I'm also a statistics student back at my university meaning that I have to deal with the statistical and  data science languages such as R and SQL.
